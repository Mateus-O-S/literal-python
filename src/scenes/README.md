# development guide
This is a development guide section introducing the scenes

All scenes derive the Scene class in the scene.py. There are three scenes in the project: initial_scene, main_scene, and lose_scene. The initial scene is the main menu of the game and appears before the game start. The main scene is the game. The lose scene is a lose menu that appears when the player dies.
